# The Background Generator (ver 2017)
---------
Written by Roy Gero in Java
## Purpose of the Program
I have always been a fan of procedurally generated backgrounds. With this interested in mind, I set out to create a program that generated one based on a set of inputs. This is actually the second attempt that I've made to write something that generated an image I enjoyed. The previous version is located [here](https://github.com/rgero/BackgroundGenerator).

##### Images from the Generator
Images from the tool will be coming soon. I am collecting a couple that I truly enjoy.

##### Features
- The ability to generate backgrounds based on Triangles, Squares, and Diamonds
- The ability to specify a color palette or use an existing image for one.
- The ability to add outlines to an existing image or newly created background
- The ability to add noise to an existing image or newly created background
